WARNING: Work in progress!

This chapter is an overview of {method}.
It aims at making this companion book self-content.
We highly recommend, for more details and a full description of the subtleties of {method}, to read the corresponding {Handbook}.
Besides, this chapter does not cover the following aspects of {method} that the {Handbook} fully addresses:

- General principles of requirements (see {Handbook}, chapter 2)
- Quality criteria for requirements (see {Handbook}, chapter 4)
- How to write requirements (see {Handbook}, chapter 6)
- Completeness (see {Handbook}, chapter 11)
- Verification (see {Handbook}, chapter 12)

== Basic principles

{method} takes its name as a reminder of the four dimensions of requirements, leading to the organization of requirements in four books (<<structure>> will detail this books' structure): 

Goals:: the needs of the target organization, which the *system* will address.

System:: a set of related artifacts, devised to help meet certain *goals*.

Project:: the set of human processes involved in the planning, construction, revision and operation of the *system*.

Environment:: the set of entities external to the *project* and *system* but with the potential to affect the *goals*, *project* or *system* or be affected by them.

NOTE: All this document will follow, as much as possible, the color convention illustrated by the logo (see <<logo>>).

=== Kind of requirements

A requirement is a relevant statement about a project, environment, goal, or system.
The {Handbook} defines important notions such as property, statements, relevance, or stakeholders.

To describe the kinds of requirements, let us start with the one that may arise in all four PEGS dimensions: component, responsibility, limit and role.

NOTE: This structure can influence the organization of a document in books. It can also be lead to requirements packages (e.g., in <<templates, SysML>>) or folders (e.g., in a spreadsheet).
