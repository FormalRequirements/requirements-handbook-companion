WARNING: Work in progress!

This chapter is an overview of {method}.
It aims at making this companion book self-content.
We highly recommend, for more details and a full description of the subtleties of {method}, to read the corresponding {Handbook}.
Besides, this chapter does not cover the following aspects of {method} that the {Handbook} fully addresses:

- General principles of requirements (see {Handbook}, chapter 2)
- Quality criteria for requirements (see {Handbook}, chapter 4)
- How to write requirements (see {Handbook}, chapter 6)
- Completeness (see {Handbook}, chapter 11)
- Verification (see {Handbook}, chapter 12)

== Basic principles

=== Universe of discourse

[[logo]]
.The {method} logo
image::pegs.png[]

{method} takes its name as a reminder of the four dimensions of requirements, leading to the organization of requirements in four books (<<structure>> will detail this books' structure): 

Goals:: the needs of the target organization, which the *system* will address.

System:: a set of related artifacts, devised to help meet certain *goals*.

Project:: the set of human processes involved in the planning, construction, revision and operation of the *system*.

Environment:: the set of entities external to the *project* and *system* but with the potential to affect the *goals*, *project* or *system* or be affected by them.

NOTE: All this document will follow, as much as possible, the color convention illustrated by the logo (see <<logo>>).

=== Kind of requirements

A requirement is a relevant statement about a project, environment, goal, or system.
The {Handbook} defines important notions such as property, statements, relevance, or stakeholders.

NOTE: Some kinds have special cases (e.g., _Role_ being a special case of _Responsibility_). In this book, we only consider main topics for simplicity. Refer to section 1.3 of the {Handbook} for more details.

==== Requirements applying to all dimensions
To describe the kinds of requirements, let us start with the one that may arise in all four PEGS dimensions: component, responsibility, limit and role.

:component: 💻
:responsibility: 👑
:limit: ✂️ 
:role: 👷

[cols="1,2,4",options="header"]
|===
| Icon              | Kind              | Quick description 
//----------------------------------------------
| {component}       | Component        | Identification of a part
| {responsibility}  | Responsibility   | Assignment of behavior or task to component
| {limit}           | Limit            | Exclusion from scope of requirements
|=== 
//----------------------------------------------

==== Requirements affecting goals

WARNING: Rationale is not in the {handbook} => Question to Bertrand
//----------------------------------------------
[cols="1,2,4",options="header"]
|===
| Icon        | Kind        | Quick description 
//----------------------------------------------
| {goal}      | Goal        | Desired result for the target organization
| {obstacle}  | Obstacle    | Goal describing a property to be overcome
|=== 
//----------------------------------------------

TIP: If you are surprised to see _Obstacle_ but not _Rationale_, which often go together in other approaches (e.g. in SysML), this is because in the {Handbook}' classification, there is a special case of _Meta-requirement_, called _Justification_ that plays this role.

project, environment, goals or system)

[[structure]]
== Overall structure

NOTE: This structure can influence the organization of a document in books. It can also be lead to requirements packages (e.g., in <<templates, SysML>>) or folders (e.g., in a spreadsheet).
