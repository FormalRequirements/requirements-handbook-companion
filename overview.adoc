WARNING: Work in progress!

This chapter is an overview of {method}.
It aims at making this companion book self-content.
For more details and a complete description of the subtleties of {method}, we highly recommend reading the corresponding {Handbook}.
Besides, this chapter does not cover the following aspects of {method} that the {Handbook} fully addresses:

- General principles of requirements (see {Handbook}, chapter 2)
- Quality criteria for requirements (see {Handbook}, chapter 4)
- How to write requirements (see {Handbook}, chapter 6)
- Completeness (see {Handbook}, chapter 11)
- Verification (see {Handbook}, chapter 12)

== Basic principles

=== Universe of discourse

[#logo]
.The {method} logo
image::pegs.png[]

{method} takes its name as a reminder of the four dimensions of requirements, leading to the organization of requirements in four books (<<structure>> will detail this books' structure): 

Goals:: the needs of the target organization, which the *system* will address.

System:: a set of related artifacts, devised to help meet certain *goals*.

Project:: the set of human processes involved in the planning, construction, revision, and operation of the *system*.

Environment:: the set of entities external to the *project* and *system* but with the potential to affect the *goals*, *project* or *system* or be affected by them.

NOTE: All this document will follow, as much as possible, the color convention illustrated by the logo (see <<logo>>).

=== Kind of requirements

A requirement is a relevant statement about a project, environment, goal, or system.
The {Handbook} defines important notions such as property, statements, relevance, or stakeholders.

NOTE: Some kinds have special cases (e.g., _Role_ being a special case of _Responsibility_). In this book, we only consider main topics for simplicity. Refer to section 1.3 of the {Handbook} for more details.

==== Requirements applying to all dimensions

To describe the kinds of requirements, let us start with the one that may arise in all four PEGS dimensions: component, responsibility, limit, and role.

|===
| Icon              | Kind              | Quick description 
//----------------------------------------------
| {component}       | Component        | Identification of a part
| {responsibility}  | Responsibility   | Assignment of behavior or task to component
| {limit}           | Limit            | Exclusion from scope of requirements
|=== 
//----------------------------------------------

==== Requirements affecting goals

WARNING: Rationale is not in the {handbook} => Question to Bertrand

| Icon        | Kind        | Quick description 
//----------------------------------------------
| {goal}      | Goal        | Desired result for the target organization
| {obstacle}  | Obstacle    | Goal describing a property to be overcome
|=== 
//----------------------------------------------

TIP: If you are surprised to see _Obstacle_ but not _Rationale_, which often go together in other approaches (e.g., in SysML), this is because, in the {Handbook}' classification, there is a special case of _Meta-requirement_, called _Justification_ that plays this role.

[[structure]]
== Standard plan for requirements

The proposed plan for requirements specification intends to update the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011 standard and address modern projects' needs.

Depending on the tooling associated with requirements management (database, spreadsheets, textual documentation, dedicated tools), the principles described in this chapter will remain.

[#4pegs]
.The four PEGS
image::classification.svg[]
As illustrated by <<4pegs>>, requirements are organized into four main parts.
These parts can become packages, folders, chapters, or databases.
In the remaining description, we will consider dealing with a textual document such as Google Doc, for example.

=== The four pegs

=== Metadata

Each organization will have its specific additional information.
In {Method}, only front and back matters are used to illustrate such additional components.


=== Goals

The Goals book describes the needs of the target organization, which the system to be developed will address.
It is composed of seven chapters.

G.1 Overall context and goals:: 
A general introduction that explains why the project is needed, recalls the business context, and presents the general business objectives. 

G.2 Current situation::
The current situation, justifying further why the project is needed.

G.3 Expected benefits::
The business benefits expected from the successful execution of the project. 
+
NOTE: This chapter is the core of the Goals book, describing what the organization expects from the system.

G.4 Functionality overview::
A short overview of the future system, enabling the reader to get a quick grasp of what the system will be.

G.5 High-level usage scenarios::
Main scenarios (use cases) that the system should cover. 
+
TIP: The scenarios chosen for appearing here should be limited to the main usage patterns, and expressed in user terms, independently of the system‚Äôs structure. The detailed usage scenarios will appear in the System book (chapter S.4).

G.6 Limitations and exclusions::
What the system will not do. 

G.7 Stakeholders and requirements sources::
Lists of stakeholders and other requirements sources. 
+
TIP: Stakeholders should be categories of people, rather than individuals (for example ‚Äúcompany CEO‚Äù rather than the person‚Äôs name). To avoid forgetting any category of people whose input is relevant
to the project, you should start from the detailed lists in ‚ÄúCategories
of stakeholders‚Äù (see <<categoriesStakeholder>>).
